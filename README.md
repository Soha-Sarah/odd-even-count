# odd-even-count
 A simple Python program to count the number of odd and even numbers  

# How To Use  
 There are two codes which works same  
 The first code is done by using for loop and the second code is with while loop  
 First copy and paste the code you want in an IDE which supports Python (remove the single triple quotes if you choose the while loop  

# Output  
 You will be asked to input 5 numbers individually  
 Say you gave 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 
 The output should be  
 ```python
 number of even values:  3
 number of odd values:  2
 ```
# Alteration  
 If you want to change the amount of input then you can change the line of code written below to whichever number  
 ```python
    for count in range(0, 5):
 ```

# Things to consider if you alter the number  of input  
 in python the index always start with 0, therefore you should only change the second number ("5")
